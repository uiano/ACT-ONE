TODO for ACT ONE
- Move project to github
- bootstrap=true - can we avoid that?
- why is codegen of battelships so slow? --> get output should produce a reference, not a name
- add a hint that display can be vertical
- create unit tests for the editor and the code generation
- add binary operators as binary (with parenthesis)
- align constructor and variable definitions (: and ->)
- improve user interface - replace the standard texts for empty and not available
- build directly on tools.uia.no and avoid distribution folder
- implement or remove subsorts
- remove variables from completion menu for reduce and let
- use forall in NoVariablesInReductionsCheck and in VariableInLeftHand
- improve editors such that you can type the verbatim text
- create warning when operators are not defined on all constructors
- create warning when axiom left sides overlap (some values defined twice)
- make SMALLINT reduce: exp(O(), s(s(s(s(s(s(s(s(O()))))))))) give two solutions: 0 and s(0)
- find let references in other let definitions
- allow printing of specifications
