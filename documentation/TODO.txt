TODO for ACT ONE
- Import of own specifications does not work, see Import_SANDBOX
- We never get the result "NO REDUCTION FOUND:" in debug
- bootstrap=true - can we avoid that?
- underline should not be allowed on RHS
- why is codegen of battleships so slow? --> get output should produce a reference, not a name
- add a hint that display can be vertical
- create unit tests for the editor and the code generation
- add binary operators as binary (with parenthesis)
- align constructor and variable definitions (: and ->)
- improve user interface - replace the standard texts for empty and not available
- build directly on tools.uia.no and avoid distribution folder
- implement or remove subsorts
- remove variables from completion menu for reduce and let
- use forall in NoVariablesInReductionsCheck and in VariableInLeftHand
- improve editors such that you can type the verbatim text
- create warning when operators are not defined on all constructors
- create warning when axiom left sides overlap (some values defined twice)
- make SMALLINT reduce: exp(O(), s(s(s(s(s(s(s(s(O()))))))))) give two solutions: 0 and s(0)
- find let references in other let definitions
- allow printing of specifications
- remove the unused icons
- check the errors that appear if you download a fresh copy of ACT ONE and maybe describe the startup sequence.
