## Contribution to the development of the MPS IDE
It is possible to contribute to the development of the language tool ACT ONE. In this case, you need to [install MPS](https://www.jetbrains.com/mps/download).
Then, you clone this repository somewhere on your computer.
Now you start MPS and open the clone as project.
Alternatively, you can clone the project directly from MPS.

Please contact andreas.prinz@uia.no in order to synchronize the development work.
